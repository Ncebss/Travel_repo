# Cachedflow Technologies — Website (Portfolio of Evidence, Part 2)

Student: Nceba Majola (ST10537199)
Module: Website Development
Site pages: cachedflow.html (Home), features.html, pricing.html, about.html, contact.html

This README documents the research and decision-making that informed the design and content of the site, following on from the proposal submitted in Part 1.

## 1. Purpose of this document

The Part 1 proposal set out the goals, target audience, KPIs, and a low-fidelity wireframe for Cachedflow Technologies. This README records the research that shaped how those goals were translated into the five HTML pages, and lists the sources consulted.

## 2. Competitor and market research

To position Cachedflow's messaging correctly, I looked at how existing B2B lead-generation and sales-outreach tools present themselves, since these are the closest comparable products/services:

- Apollo.io and Hunter.io — reviewed for how they explain "email outreach" in plain, benefit-led language rather than technical jargon, which shaped the one-line feature descriptions used on the Home and Features pages (e.g. "Targeted outreach that reaches qualified prospects directly").
- Woodpecker.co and Reply.io — reviewed for typical B2B SaaS pricing tier structure (Free/Basic → Starter → Team/Business), which informed the three-tier layout on pricing.html.
- HubSpot's free-tools pages — used as a reference for how a CRM feature is described to a non-technical small-business owner in one sentence.

Findings were adapted, not copied — all copy on the site was written from scratch for Cachedflow's own value proposition (ethical, data-driven B2B outreach for South African SMEs), per the mission and vision statements in the proposal.

## 3. Target audience research

The proposal defines the audience as small and medium-sized businesses, tech companies, marketing agencies, recruitment firms, financial service providers, and growth-stage startups. This shaped content decisions:

- Copy avoids technical/sales jargon (e.g. "less time chasing leads, more time closing them") because the brief in the proposal notes the audience is "unfamiliar with the brand" and needs the value proposition explained without a sales call.
- The About page tells a short founding story rather than a formal corporate history, since a startup audience responds better to founder-led narratives than to institutional tone.
- Navigation was deliberately kept to five items (Home, Features, Pricing, About, Contact), consistent with Nielsen Norman Group guidance that primary navigation should stay small and predictable for first-time visitors.

## 4. Content and copywriting research

- Hero section wording ("Start your free trial") was chosen over a longer headline based on general conversion-copy guidance that a single clear action outperforms multiple competing messages above the fold.
- Testimonials on the Home page are explicitly framed in the proposal as illustrative (fictional, since Cachedflow has no live customers yet at PoE stage) — included to demonstrate the social-proof pattern common to SaaS landing pages, not as real customer claims.
- Feature descriptions were kept to one sentence per feature on the Home page and expanded to two–three sentences on the dedicated Features page, following the common SaaS pattern of "teaser on the homepage, detail on the feature page."

## 5. Design and visual research

- Colour palette (Deep Blue #2E5FA3, Soft Teal #4FC1B8, Off-white #FAFAFA, Charcoal #2B2B2B, Coral #FF6B5E) was selected in Part 1 based on general colour-psychology references associating blue with trust/professionalism, and a single accent colour (coral) reserved only for call-to-action buttons, so CTAs stand out against the rest of the page.
- Layout pattern (hero → feature icons → social proof → footer on the homepage) follows a widely used SaaS landing-page structure, cross-checked against the low-fidelity wireframe in the Part 1 proposal.
- Accessibility: alt text was added to every image (logo and feature icons) and form labels are explicitly associated with their inputs (label for=""), with reference to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), cited in the Part 1 proposal references.

## 6. Pricing research

Pricing tiers (R100 Basic / R1,499 Starter / R2,999 Team) were benchmarked against typical South African SaaS and outreach-tool pricing structures at the Basic/Starter/Team tier pattern, then simplified into a three-column comparison table on pricing.html, matching the structure proposed in Part 1.

## 7. Technical research

- Hosting/domain: Vercel (free tier) as primary hosting option, with Afrihost/Hostinger as a shared-hosting fallback, and domain registration via Domains.co.za or Namecheap — carried over directly from the Part 1 technical requirements research.
- Embedded map: the Google Maps iframe embed on contact.html uses Google's standard embed API (no API key required for basic embeds), referenced against Google's Maps Embed API documentation.

## 9. Notes for markers

All testimonials, team bios, and the company itself are fictional/illustrative for the purposes of this assignment, as stated in the Part 1 proposal. Research above reflects the sources and conventions consulted while building the site; direct visual/content copying from any competitor was avoided — all HTML, copy, and structure were authored independently for this submission.

This README was drafted with AI assistance, based on the author's Part 1 proposal and completed site files.
